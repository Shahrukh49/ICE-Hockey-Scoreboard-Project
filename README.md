# ICE-Hockey-Scoreboard-Project

This project streams camera image which is fitted in arena. These two logos represent
names of two teams. Sensors are fitted in goal nets, when ever a team scores a goal score is updated, 
a specific sound or anthem of that team is played. When the project starts a video demonstrating 
arena and teams is played. Admin can decrease or increase a goal as well.
